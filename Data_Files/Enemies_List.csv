EnemyName,Description
Daleks,It landed here way back in the 9th century. After a long; deadly battle; The Dalek was defeated. It’s casing was destroyed; the creature inside was cut into three pieces so it could never reform. Two were successfully transported away and guarded by the order of the custodians. But one piece was left behind. It stayed in Sheffield; where it was found 12 centuries later and was accidentally woken up. You would think a squiddy thing like that couldn’t get far. But turns out it could hitch a ride on humans. It built it’s own casing from spare parts and bits of it’s original outer shell.
Creatures of the Antizone,The Antizone was a bleak; scary place; full of strange; deadly creatures. It landed here way back in the 9th century. After a long; deadly battle; The Dalek was defeated. It’s casing was destroyed; the creature inside was cut into three pieces so it could never reform.
The Postmen,The Postmen worked for a company called Kerblam – the biggest retailer in the galaxy. It picked; packed and delivered anything you could want.
Krasko,Krasko was released from prison and travelled back in time to change the past.
T'zim-Sha,The Stenza are a warrior race and self-proclaimed conquerors of the Nine Systems.
Lord Sutcliffe,Lord Sutcliffe is rich; arrogant; untrustworthy and entitled. Some would say he’s a typical aristocrat. Big house. Huge staff. And a giant sea snake chained to the bottom of the Thames… evil.
The Brains and Harmoney Shoal,Technically a multi-nucleate organism; functioning as an infinitely adaptable; independently functioning; peripatetic central nervous system; each ‘brain’ locked inside the brain vault at the heart of the Harmony Shoal building in New York is a tiny lifeform waiting for a compatible host. The only tell-tale sign that someone has been replaced by one of these brains is a faint scar running diagonally across the face and extremely bloodshot eyes. Sometimes blue liquid (in which the brains are stored) escapes from the host body. These creatures migrate from planet to planet…and now they have set their sights on the Earth.
Bonnie,Leader of the rebel Zygon faction; Bonnie takes Clara’s form in order to infiltrate UNIT and advance the Zygon-rebel plan.
Odin,Leader of the Mire. The holographic face he presents to the Vikings reflects their belief in a god called Odin.
The Eaters of Light,A mythical Pictish Beast; discovered by the Doctor to be all too real…
Hydroflax,A malevolent cyborg known for ending battles by eating his enemies dead or alive. Don’t lose your head!
The Lice,Ever wondered why your floorboards creak as you make your way up to bed? Giant woodlice creatures; with two antennae and large pincers; they are alien insects which secretly inhabit the Earth. They can live inside wood; interacting with it on a cellular level; and inhabit the Landlord's huge wooden house - creaking around the floorboards; walls and furniture; waiting for human prey to suck into the wood with them.
Eliza ,Countless haunted house tales tell the story of a mysterious and spooky individual hiding in the attic; and the Landlord's creepy mansion is no exception. When Shireen and Bill stumble upon Eliza; a young woman formed entirely of wood and infested with woodlice creatures; they are seriously freaked out.
Flemming,A maitre d’ who can make any problem disappear. Even if he has to digest passengers himself.
Missy,The self-confessed ‘Queen of Evil’. Turning good. Maybe. It’s really complicated… Missy is the latest incarnation of one of the Doctor’s oldest friends and quite possibly his most ruthless enemy - the Master. The Doctor was first reunited with this particular ‘version’ of his old 'friend' when Missy allied herself with the Cybermen. She planned to convert the dead of planet Earth; ‘upgrading’ the fallen into a vast army of silver soldiers. But unusually; she planned to give the Doctor this terrifying force; keen to see what he would do with such power. The Doctor shunned the opportunity; however; and Danny Pink was able to lead the ‘new born’ Cybermen; meaning Missy’s scheme was defeated. But Clara wanted revenge on the Time Lady and seemed willing to kill her. The Doctor prevented this; although before we discovered what he himself would do; a solitary Cyberman – a figure which it later transpired could very well have been the Brigadier - appeared to destroy Missy.
Cloister Wraiths,The minds of dead Time Lords uploaded to a living computer. Don’t get filed. Weirdly tall; gliding above the floor in their robes and headdresses with their faces unseen; the Cloister Wraiths were found in the Cloisters; a crypt beneath the capitol of Gallifrey; and were often referred to as ‘Sliders’ by the Time Lords.
The Suits,Congratulations on purchasing your Ganymede Systems series twelve smartsuit. Your life is in our hands! Oxygen is available at competitive prices. Please continue to breathe normally; and have your credit details ready!
The Landlord,The incredible bargain that the strange Landlord offers the house-hunting students seems too good to be true. And; to their horror; it turns out it is.
Friday,Ice Warrior 'Friday' - so called because he reminded Colonel Godsacre and Captain Catchlove of Man Friday in Robinson Crusoe – was found injured and alone in a crashed spaceship on Earth in the 19th century.
Iraxxa,The body of an Ice Queen; but the heart and stomach of a fearsome Ice Warrior!
Cybermen,The Cybermen were originally human beings; but gradually they replaced their flesh with metal and plastic. In the process they lost their kindness; joy and every other emotion. They are now collaborating with Missy and have invaded Earth! As they swarm out of St. Paul’s Cathedral and across London; we look back on their history with the Doctor…
The Master ,The Master is a Time Lord and like the Doctor; he’s from the planet Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous. They were friends in their youth and both chose to ignore their people’s policy of nonintervention with other species; but unlike the Doctor; the Master chose to travel the universe causing chaos and revelling in wickedness on an epic scale.
Sontarans,Sontarans thrive on combat and delight in the rigours of warfare. They reproduce through cloning programmes meaning they can be created in huge numbers  ideal for a race of soldiers literally born to fight. They have one physical weakness  a small aperture at the rear of their thick; squat necks known as a probic vent. A blow to this can stun or even kill a Sontaran but with typical belligerence they believe it offers a kind of strength as it ensures they can never turn their back on opponents in battle. Their enduring enemies are a shapeshifting race known as the Rutans but Sontarans will; it seems; engage any species in battle. In the Fourth Doctors era they even had the temerity to attempt an invasion of Gallifrey itself. Their cunning and genius for warfare meant they almost succeeded and although they were narrowly defeated the Sontarans survived to indulge their passion for warfare throughout the universe.
Ice Warriors,The Ice Warriors are a mighty race hailing from Mars; the Red Planet. They are intelligent; powerful individuals and the Doctor has faced them at their most ruthless as they tried to wrestle Earth from humanity. But these hissing; menacing Martians have a code of honour and when the Third Doctor encountered them on Peladon he found they had abandoned their warlike ways in favour of a more peaceful; honourable approach to other species. The Ice Warriors are therefore capable of great good and terrible wickedness. Perhaps they are more like humanity than it would first appear…
Silurians,The Silurians (Homo reptilia) were Earths first intelligent inhabitants; coldblood reptilians with a lifespan of over three centuries who developed a civilisation at least 300 million years before human beings evolved. Silurian astronomers predicated the arrival of a minor planet would devastate Earth; and so the species went into hibernation; with one genetic line being left as caretakers while the others slept. Time hid their cities underground; while the minor planet became Earths moon.
Davros,Once revered as the head of the Kaled Scientific Elite; Davros is now reviled throughout all the known galaxies as the creator of the Daleks! Davros was born during the Thousand Year War between the Kaleds and the Thals and although he did join the military; it was in a scientific capacity; aiming to create weapons that would destroy his people’s enemies forever.
Cyber-leader,A CyberLeader was part of the hierarchy of the Cybermen originating on Mondas; Telos; and Planet 14.
The Great Intelligence,The Great Intelligence is a deadly parasite – a malevolent force lacking corporeal form that uses human beings as its servants; sometimes willingly; but often against its victim’s wishes. Before racing away to find Clara; the Doctor stared at Doctor Simeon’s business card and the name printed on it stirred a memory. ‘The Great Intelligence…’ he murmured. ‘Rings a bell...’ The recollection is because the Time Lord has confronted the Intelligence on two previous occasions… 
The Black Guardian,The Black Guardian; also known as the Guardian of Darkness and Chaos; was an anthropomorphic personification of the forces opposed to the powers of light; as embodied by the White Guardian. With the White Guardian and four others; he was part of the SixFold God known as the Guardians of Time.
Madame Kovarian ,We may never know precisely when; but Madame Kovarian was behind the kidnapping of Amy; shortly after she married Rory. She whisked her away and replaced her with a Flesh counterpart; took her baby and conditioned the child to kill the Doctor. Kovarian remains a mysterious figure but we know she has a strong connection with the Silence and was apparently in charge of events at the Battle of Demons Run. For reasons unknown she is desperate to destroy the Doctor and takes a terrible glee in his anguish.
The Ood,Ood are not monsters. They are a peaceful race; sophisticated and wise; and loyal friends of the Doctor. However; when they are taken over and controlled by evil entities they become monstrous creatures; acting against their instinct with lethal intent! The Ood known as Nephew was manipulated by the malevolent House and earlier; on Krop Tor; the Doctor encountered Ood possessed by an evil force that compelled them to attack humanity. When under the influence of others; Oodkind often undergo a change of eye colour; so watch out for Ood with red or green eyes! Ood individuals have two brains; communicate with each other using telepathy and although much about them remains a mystery; we have glimpsed their planet and marvelled at its majesty and beauty.
The Siren,The Siren the Doctor encountered on the Fancy in the 17th Century was able to board the ship by using reflective surfaces as portals. She identified the ill and the injured and took skin samples from them. This process left a black spot on their palms. She then enticed the sailors to touch her  a task made easy by her beauty; seductive singing and mental hold over selected members of the crew. Finally; this touch allowed her to transport them to an incredibly advanced medical bay on a spaceship where they received hightech supervision. The Siren was misguided although not evil. She was terrifying but angelic; becoming demonic if you crossed her; yet ultimately she saved Rorys life and later allowed Amy to care for him. But only after shed signed a consent form.
Autons,The Autons were robots that resembled plastic shopwindow mannequins; animated by the Nestene Consciousness as soldiers. Though they were not the only creations of the Nestenes; they were the most easily identifiable and were utilised during every Earth invasion.
Cybermat,The Doctor has faced several versions of the Cybermats; first encountering these small; deadly robots on Telos where they assisted their masters; the Cybermen; who were attempting to escape the confines of their icy tombs. These Cybermats; like later versions; were able to move silently; leap onto their victims and proved difficult to stop. Largely impervious to bullets; the Doctor defeated them using electricity. ?They later helped in the invasion of the Wheel and poisoned the crew of Nerva when Cybermen attempted to destroy Voga. The Eleventh Doctor encountered Cybermats in the Arctic and was attacked by another when he returned to England to visit his old friend; Craig.
Borusa,Fuldanquin Borusa was a notable and ultimately tragic figure in the history of the Time Lords of Gallifrey; and a very important figure in the life of the Doctor. At various points in his life; he assumed the ranks of Lord President; Cardinal and Chancellor of Gallifrey.
Judoon,The Doctor described Judoon as policefor hire; adding; Theyre more like interplanetary thugs. They have large lungs; powerful bodies and wear tough; black armour. The Judoon will punish physical assault with a judgement of death  implemented instantly and without compunction. They have a slavish obedience towards rules and when carrying out a law enforcement mission theyre singleminded to the point of brutality.
Roboforms,Roboforms were scavengers who travelled (as the Tenth Doctor said; like pilot fish) alongside invaders who took anything on the planet of value to them before the main threat (the metaphorical shark) arrived.
Weeping Angels,Possessing a natural and unique defence mechanism; the Angels are quantum locked. This means that they can only move when no other living creature; including their own kind; is looking at them. As soon as they are observed; they instantly turn to stone and cannot be killed. The Angels have the ability to send other beings into the past. This allows the Angels to feed on the potential time energy of what would have been the rest of their victims lives.
The Silence ,The Silence are a terrifying race who invaded Earth at an undetermined point in our history. They have powers of telepathy and can kill using a deadly discharge from their hands. But every Silent has a far eerier ability… Even if you see a Silent; you wont know youve spotted it as Silence somehow edit themselves from an observers memory. Glimpse one of these creatures and you may feel slightly unsettled the moment its out of view; but you wont remember anything about it. If and when you next see a Silent you may have a flashback to your first encounter; but again; when the Silent is out of view your mind will not recall ever seeing the alien.
The Gunslinger,If you ever visit Mercy; as you near the town take a moment to scan the craggy hills and plains that surround it. That figure in the distance might just be a tourist; like you. Or maybe; just maybe; it’s the Gunslinger… Tasked with ending a long and bloody war; KahlerJex and a team of scientists created an army of deadly cyborgs. They took ‘volunteers’ and told them they’d been selected for special training. But in reality these unwitting victims were experimented upon; their bodies fused with weaponry. And finally; they were programmed to kill. The cyborgs formed a devastating force that routed their enemy and ended the war in less than a week.
Rani ,Ushas; better known as the Rani and known more formally as Ushas of Miasimia Goria; or; in other accounts; as simply Rani; was a renegade Time Lady and member of the Deca. A brilliant but cold neurochemist; she knew the Doctor and the Master when all three were young; and became an enemy of the former and an unwilling ally of the latter.
Nestene Consciousness,The Nestene Consciousness; also known as the Nestenes; Crown Consciousness and Mother Consciousness to its Autons; (AUDIO: Brave New Town; PROSE: Revenge of the Nestenes) was a disembodied life force; a hive mind race and a singular entity existing as energy with the ability to possess plastic. The Third Doctor described the Nestenes as ruthlessly aggressive and intelligent. 
Sabalome Glitz,Sabalom Glitz was a rogue from the planet Salostopus in the galaxy of Andromeda. The morality of his activities was dubious even when their legality was not. Though Glitzs first love was money; he occasionally made uneasy alliances with the Doctor in his sixth and seventh incarnations; and also briefly worked with the Master.
Yeti,Robot Yeti were servitors created by the Great Intelligence; originally as protectors before using them as an army.
Valeyard,The Valeyard was a sinister and mysterious Time Lordlike individual of uncertain origin.
Atraxi,According to the Master; he was an amalgamation of the Doctors darker sides from between his twelfth and final incarnations; who frequently menaced the Sixth Doctor so he could take the Doctors remaining lives.
Hoix,Hoix had brown skin; sharp teeth; clawlike fingers and exposed gums. Hoix couldnt speak; they were only capable of growling and roaring.
Sycorax (Fadros Pullujikaa),The Sycorax were a superstitious race of warriors and intergalactic plunderers.
Matron Casp,Matron Casp was the leader of the Sisters of Plenitude. She controlled the experiments on the new humans in the Intensive Care Unit beneath New New York Hospital in the year 5;000;000;023. Casp used the experiments to cure other patients in New New York Hospital; where she was Matron. The hospital had great success in curing patients; but the existence of the new humans was kept a secret. Casp tried to divert the Tenth Doctor from the unit; but Cassandra OBrien; inhabiting the body of Rose Tyler; discovered the unit and led the Doctor to it. After rendering the Doctor unconscious with a noxious perfume; Cassandra demanded money from the Sisterhood in exchange for not informing the NNYPD about their criminal activities. Casp refused and responded to Cassandras threat by unsheathing her claws with a menacing hiss. In response; Cassandra let free the Intensive care patients. This resulted in the quick death of Casps colleague Sister Jatt.
Pig Slave,Pig slaves were genetically alteredmutant humanpig hybrids. They were both the slaves and creations of the Cult of Skaro; following the Cults emergency temporal shift to New York City in the early 20th century. As servants; pig slaves were typically used for intense labour and strongarm work. When the pig slaves captured humans; the Daleks performed an intelligence scan on each of them. Humans of high intelligence were used for the Final Experiment; while those of low intelligence were turned into the pig slaves. One individual; Laszlo; was only partially transformed.
Sisters of Plenitude (Hame; Jaff),The Sisters of Plenitude were an order of Catkind nuns; devoted to helping the sick.
Lady Cassandra,Lady Cassandra; was a former human in the far future. Along with other rich and powerful people of the universe; Cassandra was on Platform One; a space station orbiting Earth in the year 5;000;000;000; set to witness the destruction of the planet by the expansion of the Sun.
Zygons,The Tenth Doctor described Zygons as “Shape-shifting aliens from outer space!” Powerful; technologically advanced and with the ability to mimic the appearance of other living creatures; these horrors without a home had a deadly arsenal – everything from venom sacs in their mouths to the Loch Ness Monster!
Sea Devils,Multiforms can live for millennia. This one has escaped from being the prisoner of the Atraxi. Prisoner Zero is so dangerous that; to stop it escaping again; theyre willing to destroy the world. The Sea Devils travel long distances in submarine vessels; have developed heat ray weaponry that can be used underwater; and have used genetic engineering to create sea monsters such as the Myrka.
Shakri,The Doctor believed that the Shakri were a myth; a fiction to keep ‘the young of Gallifrey in their place’. But the Shakri exist: enigmatic; powerful and ruthless slaves to the Tally. The Shakri are a force steeped in mystery. They serve the Tally; but even the Doctor didn’t know precisely was this was; reflecting that some called it ‘Judgement Day’ and others; ‘the Reckoning’. The Shakri implied it was an imperative which drove them to eliminate races that could be considered a contagion. Unfortunately; this was exactly how the Shakri viewed humanity; ignoring the species’ achievements and seeing the people of Earth as a plague to be expunged before it spread into space.
Dr Simeon,Walter Simeon’s life changed forever during one snowy day in 1842. As usual he was playing on his own; watched over by his fretting mother who remarked; ‘He never talks to anyone... He’s so alone.’ But moments after she walked away; something incredible happened. Walter spoke to the snowman he was building and heard it reply. A sonorous voice concurred with his own thoughts. Don’t talk to them; the voice told him; they’re silly. Hadn’t he always said that? But still; the experience shook him… He began to run until the voice continued. ‘You don’t need anyone else!’ Walter paused… Whether he realised it or not; his life had just become colder… Doctor Simeon appeared to be the Great Intelligence’s most important human servant and his devotion was absolute. ‘I serve you in this;’ he once declared; ‘As in everything else.’ Certainly; this misplaced loyalty was extraordinary and he was prepared to kill for the Intelligence; ruthlessly letting his army of deadly snowmen loose on unarmed workers. His dedication was all the more remarkable insofar as the ongoing plan entailed ‘the last winter of humankind’. But Simeon’s childhood disregard for other people had mutated into something more sinister and extreme; leaving him hellbent on the destruction of his fellow man.
Handbots,A great deal about these resolute robots remains a mystery. We dont even know their true designation as Handbots is simply their nickname. Theyre drones with no capacity for sympathy or rational thought; but they are not evil creatures. Theyre simply doing what they were programmed to do; even if it means keeping people on Apalapucia when they are desperate to escape.
Headless Monks,The Headless Monks are deadly warriors; first encountered as they traded with Dorium in the Prequel to A Good Man Goes to War. They later assisted Madame Kovarian on Demons Run and were involved in the tragic battle that saw the deaths of both Strax and Lorna Bucket. It remains a Level One Heresy to lower the hood of a Headless Monk and some feared that even glancing beneath their cowls would result in execution. But on Demons Run; their hoods were turned back and we discovered that these enigmatic soldiers were literally headless!
The Minotaur,The Minotaur encountered by the Doctor had been locked in a prison that resembled an Earth hotel. He was one of a race that invaded planets and set themselves up as gods to be worshipped. But when the indigenous population became secularised; they threw the aliens from their world. In the case of this Minotaur; it was jailed in an automated prison that drifted through space; snatching people with discernable belief systems. Their personal beliefs were then converted into food for the creature.
Peg dolls,The Peg Dolls inhabited the dolls house in Georges cupboard. But as the Doctor explained; it had become a psychic repository for all his fears which meant these were no ordinary dolls. They could move; speak and hunt! When Rory and Amy became trapped in the house; they stumbled across the dolls and at first believed they were harmless. But after the ghastly Purcell was captured by the dummylike creatures; they witnessed the horrifying transformation they force their victims to endure... It begins with the hands... Fingers stiffen and apparently turn to wood. And then the process spreads until the victim of the dolls has become like them. The Doctor called their state a living death but when Alexs unconditional love for his son allowed George to overcome his fears; the Peg Dolls were expelled from the house and reverted to their original form.
Solomon,The Doctor has met many vile and brutal monsters during his travels but there was something chilling in Solomon’s total disregard for life  something so unspeakable that even the Doctor appeared unmoved by his terrible fate after leaving the Silurian ship. Solomon was a trader who tricked his way onto the Silurian spaceship. Once on board he realised the profit its cargo could bring and therefore ruthlessly killed its crew using two murderous robots he had bought cheaply from a concession on Illyria Seven. But things started to go wrong for Solomon when three raptors attacked him and injured his legs… Worse still; he found he couldn’t fly the spaceship and was therefore trapped with its precious cargo. When the Doctor and his friends boarded the ship; Solomon soon showed his callousness – ordering his robots to injure Brian because the Doctor questioned him. He demanded that the Time Lord repair his damaged limbs but making an enemy of the Doctor proved his undoing. When he tried to leave; abandoning the dinosaurs and kidnap Nefertiti in order to capitalise on her ‘value’; the Doctor placed a device in his craft that the ISA’s missile had locked onto. The Doctor rescued Nefertiti from the ship but left Solomon on board… Moments after the Doctor’s departure; the missiles found their mark and the vessel was destroyed in a fireball in space.
Teselecta,The Teselecta is one of the most remarkable pieces of engineering the Doctor has ever encountered. Its purpose is grim: to travel through time; locate people deemed to have broken the law; and without killing them; send them to hell. But the technology behind these machines is awesome. Also known as Justice Department Vehicles; a Teselecta can adapt itself to resemble anyone whose likeness it has scanned. But more than this; it can transform itself to take on the appearance and functionality of nonliving matter; such as clothing or even a motorbike! The vehicle is staffed by a crew that have been miniaturised and kept in a Borrowerlike state by a compression field and the Teselecta the Doctor encountered in Berlin; 1938; was Justice Department Vehicle 6018. Deadly; powerful and almost unstoppable; it was only defeated when Amy forced its ruthless crew to abandon it.
Dream Lord,The Dream Lord seems to know all about the Doctor. He seems to be an intangible being; with no physical form; a creator of deadly dreams and delusions; who delights in being offensive and annoying. He seems to be able to take the visions he creates from the imaginations of his victims. He seemed to have taken on the Doctor because he was a great challenge; and trapped him and his companions between two realities; daring them to guess which was real and which the dream. And he seemed to have cheated.
Prisoner Zero,They have large lungs; powerful bodies and wear tough; black armour. The Judoon will punish physical assault with a judgement of death  implemented instantly and without compunction. They have a slavish obedience towards rules and when carrying out a law enforcement mission theyre singleminded to the point of brutality. The beings natural form is gelatinous; a snakelike mass of glowing tendrils with a mouth full of sharp teeth. Its capable of creating a perception filter to stop itself being seen; or to hide anything it wants to hide. Multiforms can live for millennia. This one has escaped from being the prisoner of the Atraxi. Prisoner Zero is so dangerous that; to stop it escaping again; theyre willing to destroy the world.
Smilers,The Smilers are androids; mounted in booths all across the space faring version of Britain that left Earth in the 29th Century. They let people know whats good and whats bad. The terrified population keep them clean. Their heads can rotate to show three faces: happy; warning or very dangerous indeed. And if things get very dangerous; the Smilers can leave their booths and move around. Theyre actually androids; an extension of the starships security system.
Winder ,There are also the Winders; half Smiler and half human; whove taken an oath to serve the system. And all together; these unhappy people and automatons are doing a terrible thing; which only the Doctor and Amy can save them from.
Vashta Nerada,The Vashta Nerada are ravenous hunters able to strip the meat from a body with a frightening speed and efficiency. They tend to avoid light; often concealed in patches of dark that resemble shadows; hence the general warning to Stay out of the shadows if you suspect these creatures are close. Even species that are not consciously aware of the threat posed by the Vashta Nerada seem to sense their menace. As the Doctor once observed; Almost every species in the universe has an irrational fear of the dark. But theyre wrong. Because its not irrational. Its Vashta Nerada. In their natural state the Vashta Nerada are tiny but when they gather in large numbers theyre able to animate objects; including the remains of humans. Their adaptability is possibly one reason for their universality; they have encountered the Doctor in different centuries and their race has blighted numerous planets across the cosmos.
Rutans,Rutans are the bitter enemies of the Sontarans and both species have been locked in a war that stretches back centuries. The Doctor has even conjectured that the two races have forgotten the reason for their ongoing conflict! The Doctor encountered a Rutan scout on the island of Fang Rock in the early 1900s when it was revealed they were losing their relentless war and intended to use Earth as a strategic outpost against the Sontarans. Rutans share the Sontarans ruthlessness; caring little or nothing for other species. They can adopt different physical shapes and are able to kill with a single touch of their tendrils. But they are vulnerable to fire and can be destroyed using fairly crude weaponry. As a race they will stop at nothing  even the obliteration of Earth  in their quest to defeat the Sontarans.
Drahvin,Drahvins are a predominantly female species. Some males exist; but their numbers are kept low as chillingly; the men folk deemed surplus to requirements are killed. Female Drahvins are split into two groups. The largest is an underclass comprising individuals who were artificially created; cultured in test tubes. Theyre led by another group; the Drahvins ruling elite who are callous; militaristic and seemingly devoid of compassion.
Morax,In seventeenth century Lancashire; there were literal witchhunts going on in the village of Bilehurst Cragg. One of the reasons for that was because the Morax were incarcerated inside nearby Pendle hill. Bilehurst means ‘sacred tree on a hill’. The tree in question was the lock that kept the Morax secure. When the tree was cut down the Morax started to ooze out and take over bodies – living or dead.
Pting,The Pting is a small but mighty alien with sharp teeth; toxic skin; and can move faster than Usain Bolt. The creature is impossible to keep captive and can survive in the vacuum of space. The Doctor and friends got separated from the TARDIS and the Pting was eating the spaceship they were on – The Tsuranga. The Pting wasn’t malicious; but its natural behaviour would have caused the death of everyone on board the Tsuranga.
Mutant Spiders,There are around 45;000 species of Spiders on Earth. Spiders taste and smell through their feet. They give out pheromones and really like grime music. They aren’t responsible for what has happened to them. The spiders were just doing what came naturally. The Doctor taught her friends to respect the living creatures and preserve life wherever possible.
The Thijarian,The Thijarians who met the Doctor were survivors of the destruction of their civilisation. They were not there at the end; to grieve of honour them. The Thijiarians did not come to Earth to kill. They watch over the victims of the fighting; and bore witness to those who died alone.
The Monks,The Monks were an alien race who used a virtual simulation of life on Earth in order to plan an invasion. Virtual constructs included simulations of the Twelfth Doctor; Nardole and Bill Potts. They were also able to see into the future through their simulation; and vowed to protect the Earth from the devastation they foresaw would occur in one year. However; they required genuine consent from people with power and were able to sense if their consent was true or they were acting out of fear or strategy. If their consent was not pure; the person would immediately be disintegrated.
Thames river monster,Underneath the Thames; chained to the banks of the river; is an ancient creature of unknown origin. Alien or not; this giant sea snake has been responsible for the freezing of the Thames at regular intervals – none less so than during the last great Frost Fair of 1814!
Emojibots,Far in the future; when human technology has become super advanced and humans are living in small colonies on distant planets; it's no surprise that they have built artificially intelligent robots to do their work for them and keep everyone happy. And how do humans communicate with them? What aspects of human language might have survived over thousands of years? That's right; emoji!
The Heather Creature,Heather is haunted by something so strange; so out of the ordinary; so inexplicable; right at the heart of the university; that she just can’t shake it – an apparently simple puddle. And the striking defect in the shape of a star in her eye allows her to see what so many others have missed. That it isn’t an ordinary puddle at all. Her reflection just isn’t right.
The Veil,The Veil was a terrifying creature drawn from the Doctor’s own nightmares.
Lugal-Irra-Kush,A LugalIrraKush was a humanoid species originating from one of the seven planets of the Sunsingers of Akhet. They could be identified by their long crests; large white eyes and small mouths. They attended the Festival of Offerings at the pyramid of the rings of Akhaten at least once.
Fisher King,The Fisher King was a formidable warlord defeated by the Arcateenians and sent to be buried on Earth in the 1980s. But far from dead and determined to reassemble his armies; this warrior used an electromagnetic signal contained within a written message to communicate with his people. A message that turned anyone who laid eyes on it into a ‘ghost’… Strong; powerful and standing at over 8 foot tall; the Fisher King was an ancient alien warlord of unknown origin with a blaster incorporated into the arm on his armour. Standing at the head of a mighty army; he invaded the planet Tivoli and to the delight of the Tivolians; enslaved its inhabitants for ten years! Ultimately; the planet was liberated by the Arcateenians; and the Fisher King was believed to be killed in the onslaught. In accordance with Arcateenian custom; a barren savage outpost was chosen for the Fisher King’s burial: the planet Earth.
The Mire,The Mire are one of the deadliest warrior races in the galaxy – a terrifying and technologically advanced army that is feared throughout the cosmos! The Mire augment their abilities with stolen technology from every race they conquer. They are heavily armoured with tech such as plasma cannons; holographic heads up displays and scanners; most of which is crammed into their helmets... But tech isn’t the only thing they steal from their conquests  by extracting testosterone; adrenaline; and other powerful human hormones from the Vikings; the Mire create ‘nectar’ (or ‘warrior juice’ as Clara calls it) which they carry in clear vials on their helmets and consume at high points of battle. Their helmets are therefore their biggest strength; and their biggest weakness.
Leonians,The Leonians were a lionesque humanoid race. They once attempted to invade Earth using the Eyes of Hades; an amuletlike device capable of opening rifts in space; delivered to the planet by their advance agent; Leandro.
Grunt,In the 38th century; Grunts were genetically created humans with low intelligence used for menial tasks. They could become fullgrown adults in less than five years. A Grunt numbered 474 was stationed on the Le Verrier space station. They were distinguished by markings on their faces; and due to their limited speech capacity; would be unable to articulate language very well and would frequently leave out words when speaking to someone. Grunts could also be programmed to respond to any physical threat.
Sandman,Sandmen was the name given by Clara Oswald and the Twelfth Doctor to a carnivorous form of life created in the 38th century by human sleep dust after sleeping in a Morpheus pod. The pod changed the fundamental chemistry of the brain by sending a coded electronic signal to certain parts of it. The Sandmen could break apart into piles of sleep dust that were also released into the air that could gather information. The sandmen were also blind and relied on their hearing to hunt and consume their prey. The Sandmen absorbed their victims by reaching out branches of sleep dust to drag them into the Sandman itself.
Colony Sarff,Colony Sarff was a servant to Davros. He was comprised of one large and many small sentient snakelike creatures. By working in unison; the snakes were able to mimic a single humanoid individual. However; each snake could act independently and the colony made decisions as a democracy.
Boneless,The Boneless invasion seemed to begin and end in Bristol; England; where their victims were transformed into static; twodimensional images. The local community was baffled and the police appeared powerless to stop them. And then one day a young woman arrived who would help defeat these sinister monsters… A young woman who called herself the Doctor! The Boneless are aliens from beyond the known universe who have the ability to reduce threedimensional things; including humans; to twodimensional entities; barely distinguishable from paintings and murals.
Foretold,The Foretold looks like an ancient; terrifying mummy  the kind of creature that has featured in scary stories and creaky horror movies for generations… But facts about the bandaged terror were scarce as the only ones who could see it were its victims; and a sighting of the creature meant only one thing for the witness: death! The Foretold was considered by many to be myth and according to the Doctor; tales about it first appeared over five thousand years ago. Some stories claimed that a secret riddle or a single word would stop it and he also mentioned that some victims tried to plead for their lives or attempted to buy their way out of trouble; but never with any success: Once someone had seen the Foretold; death would follow in exactly 66 seconds…
Madame Karabraxos,Madame Karabraxos was the Head of the Bank of Karabraxos; where she had a clone of herself in every facility; claiming it was the only way to control her own security. But despite placing faith in these myriad versions of herself; such as Ms Delphox (pictured); she was ruthless enough to burn them when she felt they had let her down.
The Teller,The Teller was creature of awesome power able to telepathically sense guilt and turn a victim’s brain to ‘soup’ without even touching them. These two abilities alone made him invaluable to the Bank of Karabraxos… 
Skovox Blitzer ,The Doctor described the Skovox Blitzer as one of the deadliest killing machines ever created; which is quite a claim; coming from someone who has faced Daleks; Quarks and a Raston Warrior Robot… When a single one of these hightech killers invaded modern day London it was enough to put the whole of humanity in danger. The Blitzer had enough explosives in its armoury to destroy the entire planet; meaning suddenly; nobody was safe.
The Moon Creature,The creature was draconian in appearance; with four wings and a tail. Every hundred million years or so; the creature inside the Moon (which was really an egg) would hatch out and fly away into space. The creature would leave behind another egg or a new Moon that would continue to orbit Earth.
The Whisper Men,The Whisper Men were a group of featureless beings that appeared to serve the Great Intelligence. They kidnapped the Paternoster Gang — Strax; Vastra and Jenny Flint — forcing the Eleventh Doctor to travel to Trenzalore and face his fate.
Crooked Man (Hide),The Crooked Man was a peculiarshaped creature trapped in a pocket universe. At some point; the Crooked Man became separated from his mate. He began chasing Hila Tacorien in the pocket universe; but the Eleventh Doctor; with the assistance of Emma Grayling; found her and took her to an echo of Caliburn House. The Doctor shut the Crooked Man behind a door in one of the echo houses rooms; but as Hila Tacorien was pulled to NSpace; the wormhole connecting the pocket universe to NSpace failed; and the Doctor was left behind.
Time Zombies,Time zombies were versions of the Eleventh Doctor; Clara Oswald; and Gregor and Tricky Van Baalen from the near future. A tear in time caused them to appear within the Doctors TARDIS prior to their creation.
Mister Sweet,Mister Sweet was the wholly fictitious name that Winifred Gillyflower gave to a red leech she discovered in the year 1893. He resided on Gillyflowers chest; giving her his nectar. He was immediately recognised by Madame Vastra as being from the late Cretaceous Period; and a known menace to the Silurians. When Strax killed Gillyflower and Sweet tried to escape; Ada Gillyflower killed him with her cane.
The Entity,Details regarding the Doctors earliest encounter with the Entity are sparse but its clear he was forced to imprison the creature as it was devouring its way through the universe. And so the Entity was trapped like a Genie in a bottle; until one day; Amy Pond broke the bottle and released it... The Entity feeds on time energy from the past and can therefore make its victim cease to exist. The Doctors dilemma was simple: he was reluctant to keep the Entity imprisoned but could not risk it consuming innocent people. He therefore unleashed the Entity on fourdimensional void creatures known as the Chronomites. The Entity could feed on their past; only to see them circle back in time unharmed.
The Gangers,Gangers were developed to work in environments too dangerous for people. Controlled remotely by a human operator they soon saved lives and money and most believed a Ganger was simply a tool; little more than a forklift truck. But the Doctor immediately recognised they were much more; insisting they had a mind and a soul. Gangers are formed from a type of flesh; once a reading has been taken it can be manipulated into anything; even replicating a living organism.
